# Getting Started

Welcome to the User Manual for the M3D Promega 3D Printer. A feature-packed, expandable, industrial 3D printer designed for manufacturing, assembly and design operations. Fully enclosed in a 20" all-metal frame, the 15.3"-cubed build volume makes printing just about anything possible. Please feel free to add suggestions to any of the guides by creating a pull-request or issue on [Github](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Promega-Docs/issues).

Follow the guides in this Getting Started chapter to unbox, assemble and print with your Promega for the first time.
